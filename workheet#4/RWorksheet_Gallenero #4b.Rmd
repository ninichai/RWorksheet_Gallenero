```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.
```{r}

vector_A <- c (1,2,3,4,5)
matrix_A <- matrix(0, nrow=5, ncol=5)

for (n in 1:5) 
for (g in 1:5){
    matrix_A[n,g]<- abs (vector_A[n]-vector_A[g])
  }

matrix_A
```

2. Print the string “*” using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in Figure
```{r}

for (n in 1:5){
  cat (paste0("\"", rep("*", n), "\""),"\n")
}
```

3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output

```{r}
user_input <- as.integer(readline("Enter starting number for Fibonacci sequence: "))

if (is.na(user_input) || user_input < 0) {
    cat("Enter a number: ")
} else {
    current_num <- user_input
    previous_num <- 0
    
    cat("Fibonacci sequence starting from", user_input, ":\n")
    
repeat {
  
    next_num <- current_num + previous_num
    if (next_num > 500) {
break
    }
    cat(next_num, " ")
    current_num <- previous_num
    previous_num <- next_num
}
}
```

4.a What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of the dataset? Show your codes and its result.

```{r}
shoe_data <- read.csv("df_shoe.csv")
head(shoe_data)
```

4.b Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in Male? How about in Female? Write the R scripts and its output.

```{r}

subset_male <- shoe_data[shoe_data$Gender == "M",]
subset_male

subset_female <- shoe_data[shoe_data$Gender == "F",]
subset_female

Male <- nrow(subset_male)
Male

Female <- nrow(subset_female)
Female


```

4.c Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(), chart type = barplot.Make sure to place title, legends, and colors. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}

Num_MaleFemale <- table(shoe_data$Gender)
              barplot(Num_MaleFemale,
              main = "Number of Males and Females",
              xlab = "Gender",
              ylab = "Count",
              col = c("pink", "green"),
              legend.text = rownames(Num_MaleFemale),
              beside = TRUE)
```

5.a Create a piechart that will include labels in percentage.Add some colors and title of the chart. Write the R scripts and show its output.

```{r}
expenses <- data.frame(
        Categories = c("Food", "Electricity", "Savings", "Miscellaneous"),
        Amount = c(60, 10, 5, 25)
        )

expenses$Percentage <- expenses$Amount / sum(expenses$Amount) * 100

      colors <- c("pink", "orange", "yellow", "green")
      
pie(expenses$Amount,
      labels = paste(expenses$Categories,"(",expenses$Percentage,"%)"),
      col = colors,
      main = "Monthly Expenses of Dela Cruz Family")

legend("topright", expenses$Categories, fill = colors)

```

6 Use the iris dataset.
```{r}
data(iris)

```

6a. Check for the structure of the dataset using the str() function. Describe what you have seen in the output.
```{r}
str(iris)

#The dataset includes information about iris flowers, including measurements of the length and width # petals for 150 different iris flowers. 
# Additionally, the dataset categorizes each flower into three: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
```

6b Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length, sepal.width,petal.length,and petal.width. What is the R script and its result?

```{r}
mean_flowers <- colMeans(iris[,1:4])
mean_flowers
```

6c Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors. Write the R script and its result.
```{r}
species <- table(iris$Species)
species_name <- c("Setosa", "Versicolor", "Virginica")

pie(species,
          labels = species_name,
          col = c("pink", "green", "blue"),
          main = "Species Distribution")
legend("topleft", legend = levels(iris$Species), fill = c("pink","green", "blue"),)

```

6d. Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Write the R scripts and show the last six (6) rows of each species.
```{r}
iris
setosa_subset <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa",]
setosa_subset

versicolor_subset <- iris[iris$Species == "versicolor",]
versicolor_subset

virginica_subset <- iris[iris$Species == "virginica",]
virginica_subset

tail(setosa_subset, 6)
tail(versicolor_subset, 6)
tail(virginica_subset, 6)
```

6.e Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the different species(setosa,versicolor,virginica). Add a title = “Iris Dataset”, subtitle = “Sepal width and length, labels for the x and y axis, the pch symbol and colors should be based on the species.

```{r}

plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width,
     xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Sepal Width",
     main = "Iris Dataset", sub = "Sepal width and length",
     pch = as.numeric(iris$Species), col = as.numeric(iris$Species))

legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species),
       pch = 1:3, col = 1:3,
       title = "Species")

```

6.f Interpret the result.
```{r}
#The scatterplot makes it easier to notice how the length and width of the sepals on various iris flower.
#Setosa flowers have broad, short sepals that are gathered in the upper left corner of the plot.
# The sepals of versicolor flowers are medium-length and medium-width, and they are found in the middle.
# Virginica flowers are grouped on the right side and have longer sepals than wider petals.
# Using the length and width of their sepals as a guide, it's simple to distinguish between the three based on sepal length and width.
```

7. Import the alexa-file.xlsx. Check on the variations. Notice that there are extra whitespaces among black variants (Black Dot, Black Plus, Black Show, Black Spot). Also on the white variants (White Dot, White Plus, White Show, White Spot).


```{r}

library(readxl)
alexaFile <- read_excel("alexa_file.xlsx")
alexaFile

```

7a. Rename the white and black variants by using gsub() function.

```{r}

alexaFile$variation <- gsub("Black  Dot", "BlackDot",alexaFile$variation)

alexaFile$variation <- gsub("Black  Plus","BlackPlus", alexaFile$variation)

alexaFile$variation <- gsub("Black  Show", "BlackShow", alexaFile$variation)

alexaFile$variation <- gsub("Black  Spot", "BlackSpot", alexaFile$variation)

alexaFile$variation <- gsub("White  Dot","WhiteDot", alexaFile$variation)

alexaFile$variation <- gsub("White  Plus","WhitePlus", alexaFile$variation)

alexaFile$variation <- gsub("White  Show","WhiteShow", alexaFile$variation)

alexaFile$variation <- gsub("White  Spot","WhiteSpot", alexaFile$variation)

alexaFile

```

7b. Get the total number of each variations and save it into another object. Save the object as variations.RData.

```{r}

library(dplyr)

varTotal <- alexaFile %>% 
  count(alexaFile$variation)

varTotal
save(varTotal, file = "variations.RData")

```

7c.From the variations.RData, create a barplot(). Complete the details of the chart
which include the title, color, labels of each bar.

```{r}

load("variations.RData")
varTotal

varNames <- varTotal$`alexaFile$variation`

varPlot <- barplot(varTotal$n,
        names.arg = varNames,
        main = "Total number of each variation",
        xlab = "Name of Variations",
        ylab = "Total of each Variation",
        col = 1:16,
        space = 0.2,
        cex.names = 0.4,
        las = 2)

knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/worksheet#4/variations_total.png")

```

7d. Create a barplot() for the black and white variations. Plot it in 1 frame, side by side. Complete the details of the chart.

```{r}

blackVar <- varTotal[varTotal$`alexaFile$variation` %in% c("Black", "BlackPlus" , "BlackShow" ,"BlackSpot" , "BlackDot"), ]

whiteVar <- varTotal[varTotal$`alexaFile$variation` %in% c("White", "WhiteDot", "WhitePlus", "WhiteShow", "WhiteSpot"), ]

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
blackVar

black <- barplot(height = blackVar$n,
        names.arg = blackVar$`alexaFile$variation`,
        col = c("black"),
        main = "Black Variations",
        xlab = "Variation",
        ylab = "Count",
        border = "black",
        space = 0.5,
        cex.names = 0.4)

white <- barplot(height = whiteVar$n,
        names.arg = whiteVar$`alexaFile$variation`,
        col = c("white"),
        main = "White Variations",
        xlab = "Variation",
        ylab = "Count",
        border = "black",
        space = 0.5,
        cex.names = 0.4)

knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/worksheet#4/var_blackwhite.png")
```
