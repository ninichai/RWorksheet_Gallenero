## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#vector LETTERS

#a. First eleven letters
first11_LETTERS <- LETTERS[1:26]
first11_LETTERS

#b odd numbered letters
oddLETTERS <- LETTERS[X=seq(1,26,by=2)]
oddLETTERS

#c vowels
vowel_LETTERS <- LETTERS[c(1,5,9,15,21)]
vowel_LETTERS

#vector letters

#d. five lowercase letters
five_lowercase <- letters[22:26]
five_lowercase

#e. letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase
lowercase15to24 <- letters[15:24]
lowercase15to24
```
